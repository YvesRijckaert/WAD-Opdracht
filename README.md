### What is MyHours?
Students in Belgium have a contingent of 475 hours they can work a year, for which they owe a limited solidarity contribution. MyHours allows them to check if they haven't exceeded these 475 hours.

Everytime you go to work, you should submit your hours. MyHours will calculate your remaining hours, but also if your parents are still eligible to the benefits from the government.
